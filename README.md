# ODSC_Neural_Nets_11-04-17

A talk that explains how neural nets work, mathematically, alongside a walkthrough of the associated code that builds them from scratch using Python. This talk was delivered at [ODSC West 2017](https://odsc.com/california) as ["Deep Learning From Scratch Using Python"](https://odsc.com/training/portfolio/deep-learning-scratch-using-python).

The "ODSC_Deep_Learning_2017.ipynb" notebook contains the talk. It is designed to be viewed using [RISE](https://github.com/damianavila/RISE). The instructions for viewing the talk, therefore, are:

1. Clone this repo: `git clone git@github.com:SethHWeidman/ODSC_Neural_Nets_11-04-17.git`
2. Follow the instructions in the [RISE](https://github.com/damianavila/RISE) repository to download RISE and configure it correctly as a Jupyter extension.
3. Open a Jupyter Notebook by typing `jupyter notebook` in the terminal.
4. Begin slideshow mode, being sure to run all the code cells as you go along.

You may first need to install Jupyter; if so, see [here](http://jupyter.org/install.html) for instructions.

Enjoy!
